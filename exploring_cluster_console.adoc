== Exploring Cluster Console

In this lab you will explore the OpenShift cluster console which is
available to operators to assist with managing the cluster. The cluster
console provides an operator centric view enabling the operator to view
capacity at a glance, browse resources across projects and view monitoring
information.

=== Access the console

To access the cluster console, please use the URL below. If the lab is being done
with individual clusters you will have full rights to the console, please be careful
with regards to making any changes. In the case of a shared cluster, the instructor
will have added the cluster-reader role to your user account to enable browsing the console.

https://console.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}

One you login to the console, click Home > Status as per the screenshot below to view the dashboard. If
you do not see the capacity meters, make sure the project selector is set to "all projects".

Explore the console by clicking on the Workloads, Networking, Storage and Builds section. Notice the
project selector at the top, use it to cycle through the various projects in the cluster.

Next explore the monitoring section, OpenShift deploys a Prometheus/Grafana stack to enable cluster
monitoring. Click on the Monitoring > Metrics link to view the prometheus console and login using the
"Login to OpenShift" button. Explore the metrics that are available in the dropdown. Once that is done,
try constructing a query.

Here is an example query showing the container metrics for a specific pod in a specific namespace.

sum(namespace_pod_name_container_name:container_cpu_usage_seconds_total:sum_rate{namespace="openshift-monitoring", pod_name="prometheus-k8s-0", container_name!="POD"}) by (container_name)

Next click on the Dashboard link to view the Grafana console, once again login with your
OpenShift credential. Browse the dashboards to understand the information that is presented.
